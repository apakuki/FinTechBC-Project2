    "#Customer Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn or customer attrition is a tendency of clients or customers to abandon a brand and stop being paying clients of a particular business or organisation. The percentage of customers discontinuing using a company’s services or products during a specific period is called a customer churn rate. Several bad experiences (or just one) are enough, and a customer may quit. And if a large chunk of unsatisfied customers churn at a time interval, both material losses and damage to reputation would be enormous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using machine learning techniques, financial services companies use their customer data to identify behaviour patterns of potential churners, classify these at-risk customers, and take appropriate actions to gain their trust and increase their retention rate. The task is to classify customers as churners or non-churners (binary classification) based on the organisation’s historical data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the classification task, you can use machine learning classification algorithms like Logistic regression, Naive Bayes Classifier, Tree-based algorithms, Random Forest, etc. To increase efficiency, you can use advanced algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost. Use the accuracy metrics to compare the performance of the different models. You can use the Bank Customers Dataset for Churn to practice this project."
